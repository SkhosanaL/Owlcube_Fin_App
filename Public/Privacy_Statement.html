              4.2.1. Required by law.
              This most often relates to government tax reporting requirements or in terms of a court order or if required in terms of legislation or in accordance with the common law. When OMC is served with due legal process requiring the delivery of Personal Information, it has the legal duty to abide by that demand and will do so. OMC will, however, in all instances required by law, only disclose the Personal Information specifically requested.

These instances are limited, and the disclosure of information is restricted to what is reasonably required in the circumstances.
              4.2.3. In the public interest.
              OMC may be required to disclose Personal Information for matters of public interest (e.g., to assist in the prevention of crimes). Before complying with these requests, OMC will take every precaution to ensure the authorities involved have legitimate grounds to make such a request.

              OMC may process and disclose Personal Information, for statistical purposes, that does not relate to you or any person specifically (i.e., de-identified information) as it deems appropriate.
              4.3.
